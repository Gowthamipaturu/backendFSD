## First, we need to check our react app is running without errors. 
## In terminal, npm run build.... build folder will be created in our app. Inside this build folder, we can see css, js & html files seperately(as react app has jsx(html & js)format).
## after build, if there is any changes we made to code, again we need to run the npm run build to get the same changes into the build folder.
## Log into Netlify.com, deploy again, upload build folder, will get a link of our code output.
